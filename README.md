# breakout


## How to Play:
Use your right and left keys to move the paddle to bounce the ball up and break the blocks.
Every block will add '1' point to the score if hit by the ball.
If you miss the ball, the score and the entire screen is reset.
If you forget how to play, click on the show rules button.

This is a infinite game so, even if all the blocks are broken, a new set of blocks appear on the screen.

Happy gaming!
